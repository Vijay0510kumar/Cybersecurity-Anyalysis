# Cybersecurity-Anyalysis
Business context: in the last month, some cybersecurity events with different durations and patterns have been registered
##  Objective:
To analyze the duration, patterns, and impact of cybersecurity incidents in order to extract actionable insights, improve incident response strategies, and enhance the overall security posture of an organization or system.

##  Problem Statement:
With the rising number of cyber threats and breaches, organizations struggle to identify patterns in historical incident data. This project aimed to:

Understand the frequency, timing, and duration of cybersecurity events.

Identify common attack vectors, recurring vulnerabilities, and peak attack periods.

Provide data-driven recommendations for future threat mitigation and resource allocation.

## üõ† Data Sources:
SIEM logs (Security Information and Event Management systems)

Network traffic data

Incident response reports

Public datasets like CERT, Verizon DBIR, or Kaggle‚Äôs cybersecurity breach datasets

##  Techniques Used:
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Timeline analysis to assess incident duration and resolution times

Time-series visualizations for trend detection

Heatmaps to find peak hours, days, or months for cyberattacks

### 2. Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests and correlation matrices to find relationships between variables (e.g., vector type vs. impact level)

ANOVA to compare durations across different types of incidents

Z-score and IQR to detect anomalies


### 3. Feature Engineering
Created derived features like:

Time to detect vs. time to respond

Attack surface area

System criticality score

##  Deliverables:
###  Reports & Dashboards:
Developed interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau) showcasing:

Weekly/monthly incident frequency

Most affected departments/systems

Top threat vectors

Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)

###  Insight Report:
Summarized key findings such as:

‚Äú80% of ransomware incidents occurred outside business hours‚Äù

‚ÄúPhishing attacks rose by 30% quarter over quarter‚Äù

Provided risk mitigation recommendations, like:

Enhancing email security during off-hours

Deploying endpoint detection on high-value systems

###  Impact:
Enabled faster detection and response through better understanding of threat patterns

Helped security teams prioritize vulnerabilities

Improved resource planning for incident response

Increased awareness of critical weak points in the infrastructure
